# sqs-consumer-starter

This is a Docker example of how to use the `sqs-consumer` library to consume messages from an SQS queue.

Alongside being able to start the sqs-consumer polling process, it will also start a localstack instance to simulate the SQS queue. This will be made available at `http://localhost:4566`.
